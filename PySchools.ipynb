    "There is an inverse relationship between per student budget and overall performance.  Schools with a per student budget less than $615 have a 95% overall passing rate while schools with per student budgets of \\\\$615 to \\\\$675 have overall passing rates of 73%-77%.\n",
    "\n",
    "School size also impacts performance of students.  Small and medium schools (2,000 students or less) have an overall passing rate of 95%.  Large schools with more than 2,000 students have a far lower overall passing rate of 75%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Student success rate has a direct correlation to type of school.  Charter schools boast an overall passing rate of 95% while District schools are pushing 74% passing rate.  The top 5 performing schools are all Charter schools while the bottom 5 performing schools are all District schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trends show that smaller Charter schools have higher success in overall performance of their students than larger District schools.  District schools tend to be larger in size and despite having larger per student budgets, have a much lower overall passing rate than Charter schools."
